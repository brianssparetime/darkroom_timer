# Darkroom Timer project


This project creates a usable darkroom timer that can:
 - control turning on and off a safelight and enlarger
 - has a settable timer for keeping the enlarger on, with manual override or cancel
 - uses a backlit LED display (2 line, 16 characters), except when the timer is running and the enlarger is on, in which case the time is shown on a red 4 digit 7 segment display (TM1637)
 - uses a rotary encoder to control functions, set timer
 - has a buzzer/beeper for indicating end of timer
